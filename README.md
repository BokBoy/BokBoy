- Hi I'm BokBoy.
- I go by BokChoy too
- I am a general pilot who plays Microsoft Flight Sim in the Headwind A339.
- I also fly the A320NEO.
- I believe Airbus is better than Boeing.
- When I am online, I am an expert on Mac. (I can tell you, M3 is a good upgrade from M1)
- I also believe Mac better than Windows for work (but definitely not gaming)
- GPTK is annoying to deal with.
